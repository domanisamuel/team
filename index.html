          <p class="intro">On the left side of the DevTools, you can select a different element,
            and expand or collapse all of the elements on the page to make it easier to see the layout.
             On the right side, the inspector shows you the CSS for the current element. One of the really cool
              things about this is that it shows you all of the different rules that have been applied to the
              current element, including those that have been overridden due to specificity or order.
              You can also uncheck a rule to disable it, or double-click a rule to edit it and see the change live.
              You can even add your own rules to see what they will do live</p>
